This is a Django project that serves as a rest API for my monster-builder app.

## Usage

The database contains Monster models that can be accessed, updated and added to through the django-rest-framework.

utils.py Contains the game logic that receives two fighters via FighterSelectView from the frontend and returns a list containing strings for the frontend to display.
